# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title

Spike – Time Management

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:

Time management is important for our team because the project contains many features and deadlines that must be met before delivering to the client. Effective time management helps ensure that tasks are completed on schedule and that work is distributed fairly across the team. Without a clear time management strategy, there is a risk of last-minute work, missed deadlines, and uneven contribution between team members.
