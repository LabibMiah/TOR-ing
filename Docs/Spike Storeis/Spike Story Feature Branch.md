# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

---

## Spike Title

Spike – Feature Branch 

---

## Background / Context

This spike is very important since our team will be working on the same piece of code at the same time if we all upload the code it will could cause conflicts , over writing of code or broken code. We should learn how feature braches work and how it will help with workflow

---

## Question to Answer

how to create feature branches and upload them safely to prevent accidental overwriting of other team mates code?

which github workflow should we use with feature branching?

---

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 1hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)

---

## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?
- we will research how feature braches work
- test making a branch and uploading it to the main branch
- reasearch github workflow

---

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [x] A proof-of-concept (may be throw-away)
- [x] A clear recommendation
- [x] Identification of blockers or risks
- [ ] Comparison of options

---

## Findings / Notes

Summarise what you learned:
- cloning the main codde to a branch 
- pull request to review the branch before merging to main code
- making feature branches reduces the risk of breaking code
- 
 

---

## Recommendation / Next Steps

Based on this spike, we recommend:
- 
- code from the main branch should never be edited directly
- alway creat a branch for each feature
- always pull request before and review code before cominting to the main branch
- delete branch after merging

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
