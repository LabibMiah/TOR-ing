# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

---

## Spike Title

Spike – APIs
---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

This spike is needed as APIs are crucial for our frontend to communicate with the systems or programs outside of itself like a database

the risk could be with APIs that arent written effectivily then the whole application could break or that certain feature wont work e.g having quiries being made for validiating user logins that the databsae has stored.


---

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

> Example:  
> Can we authenticate and retrieve data from the client’s API using OAuth?
> Can we make sure that the data that is being retrieved is also being done bh the correct person
> Can we make sure out APIs arent redundent meaning they arent being made multiple times for the same tasks like retriving data for users

---

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 4 hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)

---

## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?
- Make sure we have an idea of what the APIs purpose is
- Make sure the APIs work
- If their are any better solutions to the API/s in question

---

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] A proof-of-concept (may be throw-away)
- [ ] A clear recommendation
- [ ] Identification of blockers or risks
- [ ] Comparison of options

---

## Findings / Notes

Summarise what you learned:
- 
- 
- 

---

## Recommendation / Next Steps

Based on this spike, we recommend:
- We familiuarise ourselves with the purposes of said APIs
- We make sure we arent making useless APIs that arent needed 
- Have readable APIs

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
