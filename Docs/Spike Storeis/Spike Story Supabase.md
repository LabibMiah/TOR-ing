# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title

Spike – Supabase 

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

We need to understand how to use supabase and invite people to the db to ensure that everyone can see and maniplulate any data within the actual projecc

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

> Example:  
> *Can we authenticate and retrieve data from the client’s API using OAuth?*

- [ ] A clear recommendation
- [ ] Identification of blockers or risks
- [ ] Comparison of options
