# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title

Spike – Availibility

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

This spikes is needed as we need to know whos free on what days as a group so we can all work effectivily and for any missed time that persom/s has missed then how they can make up for that time, the risks could lead to the project taking much longer due to not effectivly talking about when you arent free and the reason for you not being free

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

> Example:  
> *Can we authenticate and retrieve data from the client’s API using OAuth?*
> Can we be certain you wont come?
> Is you not coming going to effect the overall project in a major way?
> What lines of commutication will you use to talk about time you are missing?

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 1 hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)

## Tasks / Investigation

- Talk about the things you will do to compisate for that missing time
- Talk about how you will let others know when you arent free
- Talk about what effect that might have

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] A proof-of-concept (may be throw-away)
- [ ] A clear recommendation
- [ ] Identification of blockers or risks
- [ ] Comparison of options
