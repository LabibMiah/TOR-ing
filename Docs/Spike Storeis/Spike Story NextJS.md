# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.



## Spike Title

Spike – Next.js


## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses
<br>
This spike is needed to understand how Next.js works and whether it is suitable for developing the frontend of the web application. Since Next.js is a framework built on top of React, the team needs to research its features, structure, and benefits before committing to it for the project.
There is uncertainty about how Next.js is different from standard React. The team may not fully understand how to use Next.js correctly. If this is not clarified early, it could lead to mistakes in development, slower progress, and difficulty maintaining the frontend.


## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?
<br>
Is Next.js a suitable frontend framework for our web application, and do we have the required understanding and skills to use it effectively for this project?


## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** __3__hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)



## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?
The team will:
Research what Next.js is and how it works.
Learn the differences between React and Next.js.
Review how Next.js integrates with backend services and databases.
Identify potential limitations or risks of using Next.js.

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] A basic understanding of how Next.js functions.
- [ ] A comparison between React and Next.js.
- [ ] Identification of risks or learning challenges.
- [ ] A clear recommendation on whether to use Next.js.
- [ ] Increased confidence in choosing a frontend framework.


## Findings / Notes

Summarise what you learned:

The investigation showed that Next.js has built-in routing and performs better than standard React. It also helps improve SEO. It is suitable for web applications that need clear navigation and the ability to grow. However, the team will need some time to learn how its routing and rendering work.

## Recommendation / Next Steps
Using Next.js as the frontend framework for the project.
Allowing time for team members to familiarise themselves with Next.js concepts.

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
