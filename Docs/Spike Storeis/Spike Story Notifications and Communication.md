# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title 

Spike – Notification and communication

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

This spike is needed to understand how communication and notifications will work within the system. The project requires clear communication between academics, TORS staff and technicians to ensure equipment requests, updates and queries are handled correctly.
There is uncertainty around how notifications will be sent and what information should be included and how two way communication will be managed. Poor communication could lead to missed updates and confusion about equipment requests.

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

How should notifications and communication be implemented to ensure all users receive timely and clear updates related to equipment requests and planning?

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 3 hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)


## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?

Identify events that require notifications and investigate simple notification methods.Also identify risks such as missed or unclear messages.

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] A clear understanding of notification requirements.
- [ ] Identification of suitable communication methods.
- [ ] Recognition of potential risks or limitations.

## Findings / Notes

Summarise what you learned:
- 
The investigation showed that timely notifications and clear communication are essential for smooth system operation. Poorly designed communication features may result in missed information or delays.

## Recommendation / Next Steps

Based on this spike, we recommend:

Implementing simple and clear notification methods and ensuring notifications are easy to understand and track.

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
