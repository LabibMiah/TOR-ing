# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title

Spike – Databases Supabase/Firebase

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

This spike is very important as this will determine how our data will be stored and managed and depending on which database we use would lead to us needing to understand that technology better to use it more effectivly, the risks could lead to conflicts if you dont understand what you are doing with the database or the spercific Syntax for it too, or how secure is the data that is stored within that database as everyone including the admin will be in the database meaning everyone has the patential to be exposed to any data breach
---

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

> Example:  
> *Can we authenticate and retrieve data from the client’s API using OAuth?*

> Is the Database secure?
> Is the Database practical?
> Do we all know how to use the spercific database?
> Who will maintain the database?
> Is the database compatible with other programs/systems we are using?

---

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 4 hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)

---

## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?
- Learn the different databases
- Learn the differences between the two
- Figuring our which on is better (how easy it is to use/manage and maintain vs how long it takes to actually learn how to use it effectivly)

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] A proof-of-concept (may be throw-away)
- [ ] A clear recommendation
- [ ] Identification of blockers or risks
- [ ] Comparison of options

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
