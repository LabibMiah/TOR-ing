# Spike Story Template

A spike is a **time-boxed research task** used to reduce uncertainty or risk.
It focuses on learning, not delivering production features.

## Spike Title

Spike – Buildings for the Database

---

## Background / Context

Briefly describe:
- Why this spike is needed
- What uncertainty or risk it addresses

This spike is needed because we need to know how we will populate the rooms table in the database and what buildings go to which room so we dont have to work on an incompleted database. Since none of us have been to the collegiate campus and the given spreadsheet is quite vague it has caused some complexity in how we shoulkd go about naming the buildings and how we should populate the rooms table in the database.

## Question to Answer

What specific question should this spike answer?

> Example:  
> *Can we authenticate and retrieve data from the client’s API using OAuth?*
> What buildings do they deliver equipment too?
> Does there need to be different names for every single room?
> Is it better to populate the database ourselves or let the TORS team do it?

## Time-Box

- **Maximum time allowed:** 4 hours

(The spike must stop when this time expires.)

---

## Tasks / Investigation

What will you do during the spike?
- Communicate with stuart and get a better insight on his spreadsheet that he has sent
- Figure out the best solution to populate the database
- populate the database with the information we have been given


---

## Expected Outcome

At the end of the spike, we expect:
- [ ] The Rooms database to have been populated
- [ ] Correct builidings from the campus inplemented
- [ ] Rooms should be added to the correct buildings

> A spike is successful if it reduces uncertainty — not if it produces perfect code.
